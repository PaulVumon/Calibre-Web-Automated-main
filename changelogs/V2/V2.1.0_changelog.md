# Version 2.1.0 - Changelog

## MAJOR FIX - Synology & Unraid Users (plus those running old Linux Kernels) üéâ

- After months of working with the community to try and find a fix for the widespread issues Synology users in particular were having, we have finally arrived on a fix! üéâ
- The issue was that the most recent binaries utilised by CWA from the linuxserver `universal-calibre` mod are incompatible with older versions of the Linux Kernel (particularly versions 4.4 and 3.2)
- This meant that for users using older NASs ect., the binaries would be unavailable, rendering the CWA functions that require them unusable
- A fix was discovered by user @loli71 here in this [thread](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web/issues/306#issuecomment-2342923994) who found that the binaries within V7.16 of the `universal-calibre` mod are compatible with those still using older kernel versions!
- Therefore from now on, baring issues, CWA will use V7.16 of the mod by default to ensure maximum compatibility for as many users as possible
- Special thank to @iroQuai, @Malek-GHub and @inkanyamba for their help in solving the issue in the now closed thread [here](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/55)

## New Features ‚ú®

- Added a CWA Settings panel to allow users to enable and disable certain CWA Settings based on their preferences
- Added Ability to check the status of the CWA Monitoring services from within the Web UI
- Added the ability for users to use the Convert-Library function from the Web UI using the "Convert Library to epub" button in the settings page
- Added a new auto compression feature (cwa-auto-zipper) that automatically zips all backed up files, once a day just before midnight to minimise disk space and help keep backed up files organised. The feature is also user toggleable in the new CWA Settings page
- Added a page called "Show CWA History" in the Admin Panel that users can now use to view the historical logs/ stats of all previous metadata enforcements, conversions & imports in the Web UI

## Major Changes ‚õ∞Ô∏è

- Updated base CW base version to 0.6.23 from 0.6.22
- This and future builds now available for ARM based machines thanks to help from @driftywinds and @carlossgv
- Reworked and vastly improved the auto ingest process to solve issues for a number of users and to improve reliability and performance
    - Users who has their ingest folders on different drives to their Calibre Libraries were experiencing permission issues that could only be rectified through the mounting of a temp folder used by the old ingest process
    - With the new process these issues have been resolved on top of it being more reliable and performant in general
- Numerous changes have been made to make the ingest process much less destructive:
    - The originals of converted and imported books, as well as those that have failed to be ingested, are now automatically backed up by default to `/config/processed_books`
    - This as well as many other functions are also now able to be disabled in the new "CWA Settings" page in the Admin Panel
- Rewrote `convert-library.py` to be much less destructive through the implementation of user toggleable file backup settings, more reliable and to support statistical output to cwa.db
- Added fix for updated metadata & covers not reliably updating on Kobo devices. Courtesy of @tsheinen. [See the thread here](https://github.com/tsheinen/calibre-web/commit/a4781a62b2fde549a40b87ccabb6b0df20ce60a4)
- Added the enforcement of Timezones given as environment variables. Previously giving a timezone as an environment variable didn't change the system clock of the container environment consistently for all users and functions and so now the `/etc/localtime` and `/etc/timezone` files are automatically corrected during container startup by the `cwa-auto-zipper` service, defaulting to UTC time if no TZ was given or in the event of an error or unrecognised timezone. This has made scheduled tasks more consistent and reliable.
- Added lock file for convert-library.py to prevent multiple simultaneous instances

## Minor Changes & Bugfixes ‚úÖ

- Added greater support for special characters in Book Titles and Author Names
- Improved error handling for files that are unable to be successfully processed
- Fix for bug where the Web UI could become unavailable due to not receiving a response for a API query to the project's GitHub page. Courtesy of @Buco7854
- Made it so CWA only checks for available updates once per day
- Made it so that the "Enable Uploads" setting in the Feature Configuration screen is on by default for new installs as new users who had yet to enable it were confused by not being able to upload new covers for example
- Added oneshot service at init to check for and remove any potential leftover cwa lock files (cwa-init-remove-locks)
- Added default paths to included calibre & kepubify binaries so their additional functionality is enabled by default for new installs
- Deprecated new-book-detector as part of the reworking of the auto ingest system
- Renamed numerous scripts to make their functions clearer
- Made the available update notifications optional through the new CWA Settings page
- Fixed Library Refresh Pop-Up messaging

# Coming in V2.2.0 üçÉ

- Making CWA much more user configurable through the new CWA Settings panel e.g. giving users the ability to disable the conversion of certain formats ect.
- Restoring the ability for users to rebrand the Web UI
- Re-enabling Split Library functionality and having it work seamlessly with CWA's other features
