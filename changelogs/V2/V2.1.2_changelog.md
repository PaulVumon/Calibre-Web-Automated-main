# Version 2.1.2 - Multi-Platform Images, Personalise Your Instance and Big UI Improvements! âœ¨ðŸ’ª

## CWA is finally Multi-Platform!! ðŸ’ªðŸŽ‰
- This and all future releases are now Multi-Platform! From now on, CWA will have both `linux/amd64` & `linux/arm64` images available for each new version! 

## UI Changes & Fixes ðŸ“›
- **Fixed the user's ability to rebrand the Web UI** with whatever name they see fit
    - To do so, navigate to the Settings/ Admin panel, select `Edit UI Configuration` and under the `View Configuration` tab, change the `Title` field to whatever you want!
    - The name you select here will the replace the default **Calibre-Web Automated** across the Web-UI ect. for all your users
    - The branding will change throughout as soon as you've saved your changes, no restart required!

- Added descriptions for each setting in the CWA Settings page as well as tooltips

## Fixes and Improvements to the Book List page ðŸ¦‹
- The Header and page elements now conform to the same design language as the rest of the pages
- The Bulk Edit buttons have been moved from the Table Headings to the top of the page and some of the page headings have been shortened to maximise the available horizontal space on any given device and make the page much easier to use (especially on mobile)
- The Pagination widget has been properly aligned and centred with regards to the other page elements
- The Columns selection widget now expands to the left and into a already visible section of the page instead of off to the right and expanding the width of the page
- And in the CaliBlur/ Dark Theme:

    - The search button of the search field it now properly aligned and sized to the search field, no longer slightly smaller than it should have been to the ire of many

    - The pagination widget on the top left is now themed black, orange and white to match the aesthetic of the rest of the UI elements
