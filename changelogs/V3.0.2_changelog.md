# Release V3.0.2 Changelog

- Added fix for `/config/.cwa_conversion_tmp` not being created automatically for some users
- Fixed redirect issues to preserve compatibility with reverse proxy subfolder configuration
- Fixed Light Theme CSS in CWA Stats page and CWA Settings page
- Fixed backup bug with ingest_processor (Issue #231)
- Consolidated `cwa-init-remove-locks`, `cwa-set-binary-paths`, `cwa-set-perms` and the section of cwa-auto-zipper that ensured essential directories existed to one oneshot service called `cwa-init`

- Fixed a bug where CWA wasn't being automatically setup as intended for some new users
    - Added functionality in `cwa-init` to check for an existing app.db at start up and create one using the example copy in `/app/calibre-web-automated/empty_library` if one is missing
    -   This fixes situations new users were facing where their new instances wouldn't already be fully setup for them e.g. Uploads would be disabled, they would have to select the location of the Calibre Library themselves, the app title would be 'Calibre-Web' not 'Calibre Web Automated' ect.
    - **Now CWA boots as intended for new users**
