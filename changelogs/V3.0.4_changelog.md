# Release V3.0.4 Changelog

## CWA Library Refresh is now Threaded & Asynchronous with the rest of the application! 🧵
- Made the library-refresh function asynchronous from the rest of the application so that while it's running, the rest of the application no longer has to wait for it to finish before continuing with other tasks!
- Library Refresh can now also be used from any screen without refreshing to the homepage! Just start the process and carry on with whatever else you were doing!
- Library Refresh no longer uses a hardcoded path to the user's library and instead grabs the path from dirs.json (Issue #190)

## Other Changes 🍂
- Added available update notifications to the docker logs
- Added clickable link to release changelog in Available Update Notification

## Bugfixes 🐛
- Added better error handling for cwa-update-notification-service to prevent 500 Errors for rate-limited users (Issue #251)
- Fully restored Bulk Editing capabilities from V2.1.2 in the Books List page (Issue #222)
