# Release V3.0.3 Changelog

## Bugfixes 🐛
- Fixed mistake in **cwa-init** script that resulted in the permissions not being recursively set for `/calibre-library` and `/app/calibre-web-automated` (Issue #241)
- Fixed order of operations in **cwa-init** that resulted in new `app.db` files for new users, having root ownership and not being writable for CWA  (Issue #242)
- Added code to ensure any log files created by CWA services have the correct permissions and aren't created with root ownership, thus causing issues (Issue #234)
